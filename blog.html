                <h2>Samarthya Classes - Overall 7th rank in VTSE...!</h2>
                <p>My next blog is on the topic named as the heading of the blog i.e., Samarthya classes, those two years of the samarthya classes are the best part of my life because that gave me lots of friends, lots of knowledge, a nice level of sincerity in myself, a discipline mindset. I remember one sort of the stories of me and my sister, for just 5 ruppes i along with my didi did not take auto and come to home by walking and eat one one packet of the Biscuit named Marie Gold, that moment was precious for me and will always be the precious for me forever in my life. This is the some sort of the stories about that route, but during classes at the samarthya classes i remember some names who have a great role in my life i.e., Sumit sir, Prajwal sir, Avinash sir and one more. They teaches us on the level of NTSE exam during class 10th. At last, in the end of the year, they have a conducted a whole district exam in their intitute in which the student from the Vaishali district can register for the exam and can give exam named VTSE(Vaishali Talent Search Examination). I also gave the test and guess what i have secured 7th rank in my district and was very proed moment for me and my family because my photo was on the front page of the Newspaper on the very next day. I recieved one medal along with the certificates from them.</p>
